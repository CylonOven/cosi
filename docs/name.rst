The name
========

The name *Così* was chosen because it is both an abbreviation of the
question "Comment faire une **co**\ mptabilité **si**\ mple?"[#f1]_ and
our answer to that question: "Così! c'est comme ça qu'on aime la
compta!"[#f2]_

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] French for "How to have an *easy* accounting package?" (the project
         started in Belgium where accounting is more difficult than in most
         other countries)

.. [#f2] Italian/French for "Like this! That's how we love to do accounting!"
